Students will be introduced to the multiple stages a programmer works through to take a programming concept and produce a usable Java application.  Through classroom instruction and laboratory experience students will develop skills and knowledge in programming including using mathematical operators; order of operations and error handling, data types and variables; using “if” statements, loops, and arrays; creating menus; and drawing lines and shapes.  With the beginning programmer in mind, this course will introduce you to a new career, maybe your own! Note: Students in grades 10-12 may receive dual credit from Missouri State University.
